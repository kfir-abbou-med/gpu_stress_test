This benchmark script provides a comprehensive test of GPU performance for 3D model rendering. Here's what it does:

Creates a complex 3D model using PyTorch with multiple convolutional layers
Tests different input sizes and batch sizes to stress test the GPU
Measures:

    * Processing time per batch
    * Frames per second (FPS)
    * Memory allocation and usage
    * GPU utilization

The script will:

1. Run tests with different model and batch sizes
2. Print real-time results to the console
3. Save detailed results to a timestamped file





1. Three Different Model Types:

    * Basic3DModel: A simple model with just a few layers - like a small house
    * Complex3DModel: A bigger model with more layers and dropout - like a multi-story building
    * ResNet3DModel: An advanced model with skip connections - like a skyscraper with express elevators


2. What Each Model Does:

    * Takes in 3D data (imagine a cube)
    * Processes it through different layers (like filters)
    * Outputs a transformed version of the data


3. The Benchmark Process:

    * Tests each model with different input sizes (like different sized cubes)
    * Uses different batch sizes (processing multiple cubes at once)
    * Measures:

        * How fast it runs (time)
        * How much memory it uses (GPU memory)
        * How many frames it can process per second (FPS)




4. The Testing System:

    * Checks what kind of GPU you have
    * Monitors system resources
    * Saves all results to a file for later comparison
